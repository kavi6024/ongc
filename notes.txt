superuser: themaster 1234

so like, i have given you access to all of my files... this is the task i am giving to you

my project has 4 models

Admin -> Can control every other model (email, password)
Company -> Can create Request and Query Model objects. Must be approved by Admin after being created. (email, password, approved)
Request -> 1 Company to many Request relationship. (item, quantity, request_done)
Query -> 1 Company to many Query relationship (issue, solved)

Please do however you wish you want to. I want you to do a fully made django auth+model managing+website in top-class.

Admin could be registered using Django's built-in superuser.
Company can be registered by normal sign up, but must be approved later by Admin. Only then it can login.
